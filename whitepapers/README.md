**Hook:** "The three physical walls at 1M-GPU scale"  
**Call to Action:** Acquire for $15B-$60B (strategic necessity)

**Key Sections:**
- The three physical scaling walls

## USAGE GUIDE

### For Portfolio Management
**Recommended Distribution:**
- Tech Acquirers: Direct to CTO/CEO (Board-level discussion)
- Insurers: Via expert networks (GLG, AlphaSights) to reach Risk Managers
- Short Sellers: Confidential distribution to qualified hedge funds

### Sequencing Strategy
**Week 1:** Distribute to insurers ($10M quick close)  
**Week 2:** Distribute to short sellers (build information arbitrage)  
**Week 3:** Public disclosure threat (creates urgency for tech acquirers)  
**Week 4:** Formal acquisition discussions with tech companies
