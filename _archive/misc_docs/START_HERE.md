## 💡 IF YOU'RE STUCK

### "I don't know if the claims are accurate"

**Solution:** Read `PORTFOLIO_B_MASTER_SUMMARY.md` Section 1 "Validated Claims"

Every number has a source (datasheet or simulation output).

---

### "I don't know if simulations are trustworthy"

**Solution:** Run them yourself:

```bash
cd Portfolio_B_Memory_Bridge
python3 RUN_SOVEREIGN_AUDIT.py
```

Takes 10 seconds. If it passes, simulations are working.

---

### "I don't know what to say on the call"

**Solution:** Read `SEND_THIS_PACKAGE.md` Section "Call Preparation"

Has talking points and Q&A for common questions.

---

### "I don't know if $15M is the right price"

**Solution:** Read `PORTFOLIO_B_MASTER_SUMMARY.md` Section "Valuation Breakdown"

Shows the conservative risk-adjusted calculation.

**Alternative:** The buyer offered this structure. You're accepting THEIR number.

---

### "I'm not sure this is ready"

**Solution:** Look at the audit results:

- ✅ 8/8 simulations passing
- ✅ 8/8 graphs generated
- ✅ All parameters cited from datasheets
- ✅ Sovereign Audit status: PASSED
- ✅ Expected value: $15M (realistic)

**It's ready. You're experiencing pre-send jitters. Send it.**
