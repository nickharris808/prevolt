# AIPP-Omega: Joint Pilot Program (JPP) Structure
## Engagement Model for Tier-1 Hyperscalers (AWS, Azure, Meta)

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED (Commercial Gap 1)
**Objective:** Provide a "No-Risk" path to field validation.

---

## 1. Scope: "The 1,000-GPU Proving Ground"
A 6-month evaluation program focusing on a single high-density AI cluster (128 nodes / 1,024 GPUs).

## 2. Phases of Engagement

### Phase 1: Passive Audit (Month 1-2)
- Deploy AIPP-compatible network headers in "Monitoring Mode."
- Measure the **Causality Gap** (Time between network burst and voltage droop).
- **Deliverable:** "Risk Exposure Report" identifying unpriced technical debt.

### Phase 2: Active Trigger (Month 3-4)
- Enable AIPP Pre-Charge triggers on 10% of GPUs.
- Compare RMA rates and performance consistency vs. control group.
- **Deliverable:** "Efficiency Delta Report" proving ROI.

### Phase 3: Facility Integration (Month 5-6)
- Connect AIPP signals to the CDU (Cooling Distribution Unit).
- Enable "Predictive Pump" control.
- **Deliverable:** Full-stack validation for 1M-GPU scale.
