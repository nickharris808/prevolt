# AI Power Protocol (AIPP) Omega Specification
## Version 3.0 (The "Physical Constitution" - $100B+ Tier)

---

## 1. Executive Summary
The **AI Power Protocol (AIPP) Omega** is the definitive standard for managing the **Global Compute Economy.** It moves beyond the orchestration of data centers to the management of the **Planetary Energy-Intelligence Paradox.**

AIPP-Omega establishes the **Physical Constitution of the Intelligence Age**, defining the laws by which energy is converted into thought.

## 2. The Power-Gated Dispatcher (Permission to Compute)

### 2.1 The Hardware Dispatch Gate
Every AIPP-Omega compliant compute node MUST implement a physical **Power Gate** between its instruction dispatcher and its execution units.

### 2.2 The Sovereign Handshake
The hardware gate is controlled by a **Temporal Token** issued by the Network Switch. 
- **Requirement:** Instructions cannot be retired unless a valid token is present.
- **Enforcement:** Missing tokens trigger immediate physical power disconnection.

---

## 3. Thermodynamic Settlement (Weights and Measures)

### 3.1 Joules-per-Token Metric
The Network Switch MUST measure the exact energy consumption ($J$) required for every output token ($T$).
- **Exchange Rate:** The global exchange rate between Energy and Intelligence is settled in real-time.

### 3.2 The Omega Ledger
All compute transactions are recorded in a hardware-locked, tamper-proof ledger inside the Switch's **Trusted Execution Environment (TEE).**

---

## 4. Planetary Inference Migration (Sun-Follower)

### 4.1 Stateless Load Migration
AIPP-Omega defines the protocol for **Stateless Inference Migration**, allowing the seamless handoff of millions of concurrent queries between continents.

### 4.2 Carbon-Coupled Load Balancing
The Switch MUST migrate load to regions where **Carbon Intensity** is lowest, ensuring "Net-Zero Intelligence" at planetary scale.

---

## 5. Phase-Compensated Atomic Fabric (Perfect Time)

### 5.1 CSAC Integration
Every AIPP-Omega Switch node MUST integrate a **Chip-Scale Atomic Clock (CSAC)** for absolute time stability.

### 5.2 Active Phase Correction
The fabric MUST actively compensate for the **picosecond-scale thermal drift** of fiber optic cables to maintain perfect determinism across global cluster radii.

---

## 6. The Sovereign Handshake (The $100B Integration)
The $100 Billion monopoly is secured by the **Sovereign Handshake**:
1.  **Atomic Fabric** provides the clock.
2.  **Gated Dispatcher** uses the clock to authorize compute.
3.  **Settlement Ledger** measures the work done.
4.  **Planetary Migrator** moves the work to the most efficient energy source.
