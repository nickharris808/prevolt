# AI Power Protocol (AIPP) Omega Specification
## Version 4.0 (The "Physical Constitution" - $100B+ Tier)

---

## 1. Executive Summary
The **AI Power Protocol (AIPP) Omega** is the definitive standard for managing the **Global Compute Economy.** It moves beyond the orchestration of data centers to the management of the **Planetary Energy-Intelligence Paradox.**

AIPP-Omega establishes the **Physical Constitution of the Intelligence Age**, defining the laws by which energy is converted into thought.

## 2. Extreme Engineering Standards

### 2.1 Coherent Phase Recovery (Clock-over-Light)
To achieve planetary-scale determinism, AIPP-Omega compliant fabrics MUST recover master timing directly from the **THz optical carrier phase.**
- **Enforcement:** The Switch laser phase is the "Global Clock."
- **Accuracy:** Femtosecond-level determinism, independent of thermal fiber drift.

### 2.2 Clock-Gated Dispatch (Safe Permission)
Every compute node MUST implement a physical **Clock Gate** between its instruction dispatcher and its execution units.
- **Safety:** Physically cutting 500A power rails is prohibited for compute gating due to inductive kickback.
- **Protocol:** Instructions are retired ONLY when a valid **Temporal Token** is present, enabling the Switch to "own" the permission to compute.

### 2.3 Resonant LC-Tank (Adiabatic Logic)
To overcome the Landauer limit of heat dissipation, AIPP-Omega utilizes **Resonant Clocking**.
- **Dual-Mode:** GPUs MUST support transition from Dynamic (DVFS) to Resonant modes in <10µs.
- **Recovery:** 70% of clock-toggle energy MUST be recycled via switch-synchronized inductive oscillation.

## 3. The "Technical Knot" (Monopoly Interdependency)
The AIPP-Omega architecture is physically inseparable. A competitor cannot implement individual features without licensing the entire standard:

1.  **Resonant Clocking** requires **Clock-over-Light** for the phase alignment needed to time the LC oscillation.
2.  **Clock-over-Light** requires **Granular Body Biasing** to keep the local oscillators stable during micro-idle states.
3.  **Granular Body Biasing** requires **AIPP Signaling** to know which specific ALU clusters to wake up 14µs before a packet arrival.

---

## 4. Thermodynamic Settlement (Weights and Measures)

### 4.1 The Clearinghouse Metric
The Switch MUST measure the exact **Joules-per-Token** ($J/T$) and calculate the **Distance from the Landauer Limit** ($k_B T \ln 2$).

### 4.2 Carbon Coupling
$J/T$ metrics MUST be settled against real-time grid **Carbon-per-Joule** data to issue **Physically Verifiable ESG Certificates.**

---

## 5. Facility Compliance (Insurance Mandate)
To maintain structural integrity, facilities >50MW MUST implement **IAT Variance Damping.**
- **Requirement:** Detection and jitter-shaping of 100Hz AI loads to prevent **Structural Fatigue** in facility transformers (Palmgren-Miner Rule).
- **Insurance:** Non-compliant facilities are deemed uninsurable due to unpriced mechanical risk.
