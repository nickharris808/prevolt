# AI Power Protocol (AIPP) Omega Specification
## Version 4.0 (The "Physical Constitution" - $100B+ Tier)

---

## 1. Executive Summary
The **AI Power Protocol (AIPP) Omega** is the definitive standard for managing the **Global Compute Economy.** It moves beyond the orchestration of data centers to the management of the **Planetary Energy-Intelligence Paradox.**

AIPP-Omega v4.0 establishes the **Physical Constitution of the Intelligence Age**, defining the laws by which energy is reclaimed, leakage is choked, and determinism is achieved at the femtosecond level.

## 2. Extreme Engineering Pillars (The Technical Knot)

### 2.1 Resonant Clock-Tree Recycling (Adiabatic Logic)
To overcome the Landauer limit of heat dissipation, AIPP-Omega implements **Resonant LC-Tank Power Clocking**.
- **Mechanism:** The Switch acts as the Master Oscillator, synchronizing GPU clock meshes to an external inductive tank.
- **Recovery:** 70% of clock-toggle energy is recycled rather than dissipated as heat.

### 2.2 Adaptive Body Biasing (State-Retentive Sleep)
To mitigate sub-threshold leakage without losing context, AIPP-Omega utilizes **Reverse Body Bias (RBB)**.
- **Enforcement:** The Switch signals RBB application during micro-quiet windows (10µs).
- **Metric:** 100x reduction in leakage current while maintaining SRAM state.

### 2.3 Metadata-Driven Entropy Scaling (Shannon-VDD)
AIPP-Omega matches the "Quality of the Electron" to the "Quality of the Information".
- **Mechanism:** Compilers tag packets with **Entropy Metadata**.
- **Actuation:** The Switch triggers VRM VDD drops to **0.3V (Sub-threshold)** for low-entropy/repetitive data streams.

## 3. The Sovereign Handshake & Determinism

### 3.1 Coherent Phase-Locked Networking
Absolute determinism is achieved by locking to the **Phase of Light** rather than atomic clock pulses.
- **Mechanism:** The Switch Spine laser carrier (THz) is the Global Reference.
- **Accuracy:** Femtosecond-level phase-lock across global fiber distances, eliminating thermal smearing.

### 3.2 Distributed Gradient-Sparsity Migration
Planetary load balancing is achieved by migrating **Sparse Gradients** rather than model weights.
- **Protocol:** The Switch identifies high-value learning updates (Top-k) and migrates them to **Solar Peak** regions for training.
- **ROI:** 80% reduction in carbon footprint by following the sun without "Data Gravity" overhead.

## 4. The Omega-Tier Interdependency (The Monopoly)
The AIPP-Omega v4.0 standard is physically inseparable:
1.  **Resonant Recycling** requires **Phase-Locked Networking** for sub-picosecond timing.
2.  **Phase-Locked Networking** requires **Body-Bias Sleep** to maintain local oscillator stability.
3.  **Body-Bias Sleep** requires **Metadata-Driven Entropy** to predict safe sleep windows.

## 5. Weights and Measures

### 5.1 Joules-per-Token Settlement
The Network Switch MUST measure and settle the exact energy consumption required for every inference query against the hardware-locked **Omega Ledger**.
