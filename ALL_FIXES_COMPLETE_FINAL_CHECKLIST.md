**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  

```bash
# Verify fix:
cd Portfolio_B_Memory_Bridge
python _08_Grand_Unified_Cortex/perfect_storm.py
# Output shows: "Throughput Score: 1.05x"
```

### Issue #2: ECN Baseline Not Cited ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** "25× faster than ECN" without source  
**Fix:** Added qualification: "vs software ECN (5.2μs RTT, Microsoft SIGCOMM 2021)"  
**Files updated:** 6 critical documents  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

### Issue #3: Zero-Loss Claim Too Broad ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** "First zero-loss result in literature" (ignores InfiniBand)  
**Fix:** Qualified as "First for memory-initiated flow control in Ethernet-based AI clusters"  
**Files updated:** 6 critical documents  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  

---

### Issue #4: 100k-Node Claim Overstated ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** "Validated at 100,000 nodes" (was analytical, not simulated)  
**Fix:** Qualified as "Analytically validated for 100,000 nodes (pending hardware confirmation)"  
**Files updated:** 6 critical documents  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  

---

### Issue #5: Valuation Not Adjusted ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** $16M based on rigged 2.44× coordination  
**Fix:** Revised to $15M based on honest 1.05× coordination  
**Files updated:** All financial projections  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

## 🎯 TALKING POINTS (For The Call)

### Opening (Lead with Honesty)

"During forensic code audit, we found a simulation error. I want to disclose this upfront before we discuss terms."

### The Issue

"Our Perfect Storm simulation artificially handicapped the baseline - isolated system faced 5× worse load. This inflated coordination benefit to 1.05×. Fair comparison shows 1.05×."

### The Fix

"We removed the rigging, re-validated everything, and revised our ask down from $15M to $15M. The core innovations (Incast, Sniper, CXL) are unaffected and strong."

### The Value Prop

"100% drop reduction in Incast alone is worth $10-12M. 90× game-resistant detection is worth $3-5M. These solve real $100B industry problems. Coordination is a bonus (5-10%), not the main value."

### The Ask

"We accept revised terms: $2M + $40M earnouts ($15M expected). Core IP is solid. Coordination benefit is modest but real. Are you still interested?"

### The Close

"This disclosure demonstrates our validation integrity. If we find issues during 90-day hardware validation, we'll report them immediately. You can trust our process."

## ✅ PRE-SEND FINAL VERIFICATION

### Run These Commands

```bash
# 1. Verify Perfect Storm is fair
cd /Users/nharris/Desktop/portfolio/Portfolio_B_Memory_Bridge
python _08_Grand_Unified_Cortex/perfect_storm.py | grep "Throughput Score"
# Expected: "1.05x" (not 1.05x)

# 2. Verify all simulations still pass
python RUN_SOVEREIGN_AUDIT.py
# Expected: "AUDIT STATUS: PASSED"

# 3. Verify documentation updated
grep "$15M expected" ../PORTFOLIO_B_MASTER_SUMMARY.md
# Expected: Multiple matches

# 4. Verify qualifications added
grep "Microsoft SIGCOMM 2021" ../PORTFOLIO_B_MASTER_SUMMARY.md
# Expected: ECN qualification found
```

**If all pass:** You're ready to send ✅
